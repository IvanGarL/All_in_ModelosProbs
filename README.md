# Uniandes - IIND2104 Probabilistic models, final project.

Here is a visualization tools build on R, using markovchain, plotly, shinyApp and  other visualization packages. The main idea was to build a model that helps the health department of the goverment to take better decisions about resources and priority scenarios under the terms given by the requirements report given alogn the course (2019-2nd semestre).

The different scenarios were modeled as decision markovian processes, using both discret and continuous markov chains to apply, stady state and transient analysis to the models so conclusions could be made under theorical results. 

In the final stage of the project the task were to find the optimal decision process that should take a person with cancer given an initial state and the age of the patient. This was done using the model of a MDP (Markovian Decision Process) apply to the theory of the optimal principle and the bellman equations concepts.

Have into account:
  - All the information material of the different stages, the comments of the code and the app is in spanish.
  - All the requirements report could be found on the ./reqs directory
